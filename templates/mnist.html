  <p><em>Classification</em></p>
  <p>
    Description: The MNIST dataset is a large collection of handwritten digits
    widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.
    Comprising 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, this dataset
    serves as the benchmark for evaluating the performance of image processing
    systems. The simplicity of the MNIST dataset makes it an ideal starting
    point for any machine learning project, including ours, which focuses on the
    decentralized training of AI models. By starting with MNIST, we can
    establish a foundational model that can later be expanded to more complex
    datasets and challenges.
