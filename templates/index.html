<h2>Description of Masters Project</h2>
<p>
  This project is focused on creating a web application that aims to
  decentralize artificial intelligence (AI). By leveraging the principles of
  federated learning and blockchain technology, the goal is to allow
  participants to contribute their data to train a base AI model
  collaboratively. The MNIST dataset, a foundational dataset in the field of
  machine learning, serves as the starting point for this initiative.
  Participants can join the project, contribute their MNIST data for model
  training, and potentially improve the model's accuracy. Improvements to the
  model are validated and then recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency
  and integrity in the model's development process.
